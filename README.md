## About the Project
VINTAGE, in collaboration with the Remote Experimental Team at Rosemary Hill Observatory (RETRHO) at the University of Florida, is developing a new website to improve public engagement and streamline data management for the observatory. Under the guidance of Dr. Jamie Tayar, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Astronomy, this platform will serve as a hub for sharing astronomical observations, scheduling telescope usage, and organizing internal team resources.

## Why This Website Matters
This project aims to create a modern, user-friendly website that will:
- Allow the public to explore observational data and telescope availability.
- Provide RETRHO members with a secure platform to manage internal documents and data.
- Improve accessibility and increase engagement with the observatory’s resources.

## Who Will Use This Website?
The new platform will be designed for:

- RETRHO Members – to organize and manage their research projects efficiently.
- UF Students & Researchers – to access and collaborate on astronomical studies.
- The General Public – to learn about space phenomena and follow the observatory’s work.

By creating a more interactive and well-structured online presence, this project will enhance the visibility of RETRHO’s work while ensuring that valuable observational data is easily accessible and well-preserved for future use.
