# RETRHO Website, by VINTAGE
## About the Project
VINTAGE, in collaboration with the Remote Experimental Team at Rosemary Hill Observatory (RETRHO), is developing a new website to improve public engagement and streamline data management for the observatory. Under the guidance of Dr. Jamie Tayar, this platform will serve as a hub for sharing astronomical observations, scheduling telescope usage, and organizing internal team resources.

## Why This Website Matters
This project aims to create a modern, user-friendly website that will:
- Allow the public to explore observational data and telescope availability.
- Provide RETRHO members with a secure platform to manage internal documents and data.
- Improve accessibility and increase engagement with the observatory’s resources.

## Who Will Use This Website?
The new platform will be designed for:

- RETRHO Members – to organize and manage their research projects efficiently.
- UF Students & Researchers – to access and collaborate on astronomical studies.
- The General Public – to learn about space phenomena and follow the observatory’s work.
By creating a more interactive and well-structured online presence, this project will enhance the visibility of RETRHO’s work while ensuring that valuable observational data is easily accessible and well-preserved for future use.
